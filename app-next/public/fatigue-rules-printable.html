  <h1>Fatigue Management Rules</h1>
  <p class="subtitle">WA OSH Regulation 3.132 — Commercial Driver Fatigue</p>
  <p class="meta">This document lists all rules applied in the Fatigue Record app. Print or save as PDF for reference.</p>

  <h2>Before starting a shift</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Minimum 7 hours non-work since last shift.</strong> The app blocks “Start shift” until at least 7 hours have passed since the last “End shift” (rolling time; no day boundary).</li>
    <li><strong>Today’s card must be completed:</strong> Rego, Destination, and Start KM must be entered (or carried over) before work time is recorded.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>5-hour work / break rule (all drivers)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>20 minutes break for every 5 hours work time</strong> — at least 10 minutes in one block (e.g. 2×10 min or 1×20 min).</li>
    <li>Breaks under 10 minutes are counted as work time.</li>
    <li>Only one violation is raised per “block”; the block resets when a valid break is taken or on “End shift”.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Solo driver rules</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">Applied when driver type is Solo. Rolling checks use the last 3 days of the previous week when available.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>≥7 continuous hours non-work</strong> required (within a day that has work).</li>
    <li><strong>17-hour rule:</strong> Two periods of non-work time (each longer than 7 hours) cannot be separated by more than 17 hours of work and break combined. A 24-hour continuous non-work period resets this rule.</li>
    <li><strong>≥27 hours non-work in any rolling 72 hours</strong>, including at least 3 blocks of ≥7 continuous hours non-work. A 24-hour continuous non-work period resets this rule.</li>
    <li><strong>Max 168 hours work in any 14-day period</strong> (rolling). The 14-day period resets after ≥48 hours continuous non-work.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Two-Up driver rules</h2>
  <p class="section-intro">Applied when driver type is Two-Up.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>≥7 hours non-work in any rolling 24 hours</strong> (can be in a moving vehicle).</li>
    <li><strong>≥1 block of ≥7 continuous hours non-work in any rolling 48 hours</strong> (not in a moving vehicle).</li>
    <li><strong>≥48 hours non-work per 7 days</strong>, including at least one block of ≥24 continuous hours non-work.</li>
    <li><strong>Max 168 hours work in any 14-day period</strong> (rolling). Resets after ≥48 hours continuous non-work.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How rules are evaluated</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Time is recorded as <strong>work</strong>, <strong>break</strong>, or <strong>non-work</strong> in 30-minute slots per calendar day.</li>
    <li>Rolling rules (17h, 72h, 24h, 48h, 14-day) run over a continuous timeline; the app includes the previous week’s last 3 days where relevant so boundaries between weeks are respected.</li>
    <li>Declared “24-hour break” (last 24h break date) can reset Solo rolling rules for that boundary.</li>
    <li>Violations and warnings are shown in the Compliance Check panel and may block or warn before logging work.</li>
  </ul>
